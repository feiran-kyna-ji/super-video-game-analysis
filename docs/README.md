## Code
Our final html can be found [here](https://github.com/chenxi-ge/super-video-game-analysis/blob/master/docs/final.html).
Our final python code can be found in the analysis folder, with the name of each jupyter-notebook indicates if the analysis belongs the exploratory analysis (alpha) or final analysis (beta).

## Usage
